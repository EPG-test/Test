# Kingdom-of-mechanical-test-for-deciv.
Mod for deciv where I can test my own ideas.
 
The Forgotten Kingdom:
This Kingdom's name is a real secret. Why? Nobody just bothered to ask so... everyone started naming it "The FOrgotten Kindom Of Wasteland"
This beloved by many faction started as a small city state like being. But everything changed when the (fir-) Verdict of expansion had been accepted by the King.
Of course inexperience with outsied world and fear of the unknown were huge problems not not only to the new explorers but also Capital city residents too. 
Resource Scarcity, Bandits, Unforgettable (Unforgivable) terrain and climate. But don't worry everything will be just fine right?

Last Bastion"
Post doomsday cult faction main objective is to **REPENT**. **REPENT** for the sins of Humanity. **REPENT** in front of the new garden of Eden.
**REPENT** in front of The God.
Highly religious and friendly (only to people who don't believe in things that are taboo to thier bieliefs.) Thier work should be full of virtues right?
(They have PTSD from the Cataclysm But they call it "The Armageddon" like the biblical one from book of revealtions)

ALL-IN-ONE Company:
One of the Corporations who saved itself from The Nuclear devastation. Thier motto is "Everything you want will be fullfilled by us" and they actually do that but for a price of our freedom... Yes you have everthing you need, but not what you want (But they say otherwise). Morally grey, cares about its **customers** but treats its people as **customers** so maybe if someone could be lucky promotion to a **worker** is possible. Nobody choice is important than the **Supervisors** and the **CEO** of this company soo be at thier blessing. Maybe living in a comfortable dictatorship won't be so bad after all right?

Extractinators:
Strange gang that formed around the wasteland. Really disorganized outside thier borders but great at bureaucracy inside. Why? Thier people.
There are 2 classes of poeple in this faction the "outsiders"- nearly slaves, workers and most of thier army is composed of them.
And "Insiders"- Mostly educated people capable of reasoning. The name "Extractinators" is from they opinion on wasteland. The only usage is to extract everything they can lands, waters, ruins and rubbles, mountains, other faction cities and people... and they do that with great succsess but at a price... Slaves, the "outsiders" are just brainless pawns in game they don't understand. At least it is done for good of humanity, right?
