The Forgotten Kingdom:
This Kingdom's name is a real secret. Why? Nobody just bothered to ask so... everyone started naming it "The FOrgotten Kindom Of Wasteland"
This beloved by many faction started as a small city state like being. But everything changed when the (fir-) Verdict of expansion had been accepted by the King.
Of course inexperience with outsied world and fear of the unknown were huge problems not not only to the new explorers but also Capital city residents too. 
Resource Scarcity, Bandits, Unforgettable (Unforgivable) terrain and climate. But don't worry everything will be just fine right?
