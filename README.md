Lore update but small one

The lore of "The Forgotten Kingdom of Wasteland",

place on world - Author note: TBH I have no clue where Kingdom could be ( NOT Americas - my choice )

Ruler "The King" ( maybe a name will be added") - Person whose experience and knowledge of politics has made him a virtous king.

Kingdom - *was*  a city-state like being until a decree of anti-isolationism was adopted. Then it started expanding with fear of the unknown.


But The King has plans covered with mystery.

Are his plans to wage endless wars? To create a perfect society? To change Earth into a better place? or just have a good sleep... Well it depends on YOU
