# Kingdom-of-mechanical-test-for-deciv.
Mod for deciv where I can test my own ideas.
 
The Forgotten Kingdom:

This **Kingdom's** name is a real secret. Why? Nobody just bothered to ask so... everyone started naming it **"The Forgotten Kindom Of Wasteland"** but in real the name is just "Merra".
This beloved by many faction started as a small **city state** like being. But everything changed when the (fir-) Verdict of expansion had been accepted by the **King**.
Of course inexperience with outside world and fear of the unknown were huge problems not not only to the new explorers but also **Merra** residents too. 
Resource Scarcity, Bandits, Unforgettable (Unforgivable) terrain and climate. 
But don't worry everything will be just **fine**, right?

Last Bastion:

Post doomsday cult faction main objective is to **REPENT**. **REPENT** for the sins of Humanity. **REPENT** in front of the new garden of Eden.
**REPENT** in front of The God.
Highly religious and friendly (only to people who don't believe in things that are taboo to thier bieliefs).
Thier work should be full of **virtues** right?

(They have PTSD from the Cataclysm But they call it "The Armageddon" like the biblical one from book of revealtions)

ALL-IN-ONE Company:

One of the Corporations who saved itself from The Nuclear devastation. Thier motto is "Everything you want will be fullfilled by us" and they actually do that but for a price of our freedom... But Surprise! Everthing you need is fullfilled by them, not what you want (But they say otherwise). Morally grey, cares about its **customers** but treats its people only as **customers** so maybe if someone could be lucky promotion to a **worker** is possible. Nobody's choice is important than thiers soo be at thier blessing. Maybe living in a comfortable **dictatorship** won't be so bad after all right?

Vultures:

Strange being that came into life after the Cataclysm. A Corporation? Nope. A gang? Nah. Maybe fallen nation that has risen from the flames? ***Buzzer*** Wrong.
In reality it's a **organization** of unspecified role. Really disorganized outside thier borders but great at bureaucracy inside. Why? Thier people.
There are 2 classes of poeple in this faction the **"outsiders"**- nearly brainless slaves, workers and military men are composed of them, under the rule of the
"**Insiders**"- Mostly educated people capable of reasoning.  
The name "**Vultures**" is from thier opinion of wasteland. The only usage is to Scavenge everything they can. They think there is **Absolutely Nothing** to repair . That means lands, waters, ruins and rubbles, mountains, other faction cities and people... are not safe from them and they do that with great success but at a price... of humanity. The "Outsiders" are just brainless pawns in game they don't understand and other factions are just places to loot and **Utilize**. At least it is done for good of **humanity**, right?
