# Kingdom-of-mechanical-test-for-deciv.
Mod for deciv where I can test my own ideas.

THe Main faction of this mod is "The Forgotten Kingdom of Wasteland". (This is the main branch that only adds this faction
Second Branch is a small expansion of this mod with 3 extra factions, 3 extra wonders and 1 Extra city state. (In future I could add possible buildings for all factions)
Cuz I'm new to Unciv modding scene please take the balancing and my lore-writing with some grain of salt. (I accept any criticism BUT it needs to have arms and legs)

This mod Should be compatibatile with other mods and especially with the "Outlaws of The Wastes" mod by The-S-is-silent.

This mod addons:
3 New Ancient Wonders
- Crystal Waterfall - The only place of clear water deposits unaffected by radiation or contamination of the wasteland
- Desolate Megalopolis - Ruins of the the greatest, the biggest and the now ruined city ever. Its rotten corpse is just a memory of the past
- Codename "Death Grove" - Post cataclysm forest fields that just started to sprout. Whithin time it becomes the main source of bio-hazard in now regenerating wasteland (The looks of this wonder should change with eras)

3 New World Wonders
Oceanic De-extinction Project -  a rather small project that aims to repopulate the seas with either with pre-cataclysm or post-cataclysm marine life
Humanity's Revival Memorial -  Build to those who sacrificed themself to create this blooming future
Laser Cutting Facility - Specialized factory which blueprints have been lost to time. Now when the humanity has revived this beauty existence is just a matter to time ( this could be an EVENT wonder - "The Blueprints")

1 New Improvement for all factions 
"Artificial Bay"
buildable only on sunken ruins tiles
