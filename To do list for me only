- Culture Each city defense builidng grants culture and unique defense building give +5% culture, (If its possible lowers the city strenght, health) and gives unit -20% strenght malus
- Economic Increses water yields from moisture traps by +1 and each water building gives +1/+2/+3 water (possible change to give cheaper things in cities), cities get -20% to unit production -10% to building production and possible science malus to counterreact gold slider
