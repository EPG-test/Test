replacemnts for council and congress buildings but are not treated as  both of them




After sovereignity

After Rationalism
- Research +x amount of science in cities ( from science buildings or not), and +X% od science in connected cities and Capital ( Capital gets additional +5% no matter what) This % science bonus scales with each new era (+10% science in neofeudal era -> +5% science in rebuilding era going to zero 'that is only an example')| each city gets lowered water output by flat 5 and 10%
After Constitution
- Culture Each city defense builidng grants culture and unique defense building give +5% culture, (If its possible lowers the city strenght, health) and gives unit -20% strenght malus
After Monopoly
- Economic Increses water yields from moisture traps by +1 and each water building gives +1/+2/+3 water (possible change to give cheaper things in cities), cities get -20% to unit production -10% to building production and possible science malus to counterreact gold slider
